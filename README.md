# OOP-Farm-Simulator
This project while largely unfinished is due for submission, so I will outline its issues:
There is no implementation of a comparator for ordering the animals
The menu while having most of its implementation is still missing functionality and have several bugs that could not be removed before submission
Several methods are severally bloated and need serious refactoring to be anyway modular
To Conclude this assignment has thought me a quite a lot about OOP Practices and techniques such as methods linking objects either via composition or inhertance
and interactions between sub class and parent classes
